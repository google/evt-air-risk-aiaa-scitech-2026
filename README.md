# Estimating UAS to Crewed Aircraft Collision Risk Using Extreme Value Theory

This repository contains a Python library that can used to replicate the results
shown in [^1], which show the use of Extreme Value Theory to estimate the
probability of UAS-to-crewed aircraft midair collision based on the distribution
of approach distance falling short of a collision.
